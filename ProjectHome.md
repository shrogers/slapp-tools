The [SLAPP project](http://eco83.econ.unito.it/terna/slapp/) initiated by Pietro Terna brings the simplicity and clarity of Python to the Agent Based Modeling and Simulation paradigm of the [Swarm](http://www.swarm.org/index.php/Introduction_to_Swarm) software package developed at the Santa Fe Institute and now supported by the Swarm Development Group.

The SLAPP-Tools project seeks to scale SLAPP to large scale systems via improved execution efficiency, support for parallel and distributed hardware, and data analysis tools.
